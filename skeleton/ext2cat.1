.SH NAME
ext2_access \- Prints file content to stdout
.SH DESCRIPTION
A basic program that retrieves the content of a file from an ext2 image
and prints it to stdout. This program can fully retrieve large files that
do not entirely fit into a direct block. 

.SH DESIGN DECISIONS
To allow for the driver to fully retrieve files too large
to fit in a direct block, the driver reads all indirect blocks
block, until actual file size is reached or all 255 indirect blocks
are read.
